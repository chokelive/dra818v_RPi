# dra818v_RPi
## Raspberry Pi and DRA818V module control for APRS IGate

This python script use for control DRA818V chinease VHF module in receive mode only and run in Raspberry Pi (version 1) and able to work in R-Pi new version too

Script will able to scan dual frequency 144.390MHz and 145.825MHz to stand by support IGate and SGate mode.

Circuit module work by 3.3V power and control by serial interface at GPIO pin header
